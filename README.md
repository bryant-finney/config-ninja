Similar to [`confd`](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd), manage your system configuration files by populating [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) templates with data from a remote provider.

## Installation

To install using `pip`:

```sh
pip install config-ninja
```

## Development

The following system dependencies are required:

- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation): install dependencies and manage virtual environments
- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install): run linters and formatters for the package
- (optional) [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html): automatically execute the [`.envrc`](./.envrc) script to manage project dependencies

Common development commands are managed by [`poethepoet`](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet); run `poe --help` for an up-to-date list of commands:
