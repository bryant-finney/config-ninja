Similar to [`confd`], manage your system configuration files by populating [Jinja2] templates with data from a remote provider.

[Jinja2]: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/

## Installation

To install using `pip`:

```sh
pip install config-ninja
```

## Development

The following system dependencies are required:

- [`poetry`]: install dependencies and manage virtual environments
- [`pre-commit`]: run linters and formatters for the package
- (optional) [`direnv`]: automatically execute the [`.envrc`] script to manage project dependencies

Common development commands are managed by [`poethepoet`]; run `poe --help` for an up-to-date list of commands:
